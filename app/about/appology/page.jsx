        Lots of times I have done lots of mistakes. Sometimes I have broken your hearts though I am not sure, cause you really don't share your thoughts with me. Probably I am not that much good friend. So I am making this page to apologize to you for everything and every mistake that makes me a bad friend. Listen this website is not just for apologizing. Rather this website is for making you feel special on your special day and I really hope you are visiting this page and reading these lines and thinking that finding me as a friend was your best decision. The image under the heading is just for you. Even the pic of us under my quotes is a very old pic from covid time when we used to go to Panday sir, that too for a very short time. But still, after I lost my dearest Poco I only had this one in my oldest phone.        </p>
